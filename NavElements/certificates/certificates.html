                    Completion : </h1>
                <p>I am thrilled to have successfully completed my internship and to have been awarded the internship
                    completion certificate. This certificate serves from Devtown, when i was submitted my own MERN
                    project(<a href="movie-booking-project.netlify.app">Movie-Booking-Application</a>). Through these
                    projects, I gained valuable hands-on experience and was able to apply the theoretical knowledge I
                    had acquired in a practical setting. Throughout the internship, I had the opportunity to attend
                    various training sessions, workshops, and seminars. And all these sessions, training and internship
                    training are happening on online basis</p>

                <p>I successfully completed the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) course, gaining a deep
                    understanding of each component. I learned MongoDB for flexible data storage, Express.js for robust
                    APIs, React for dynamic user interfaces, and Node.js for scalable web servers. I acquired
